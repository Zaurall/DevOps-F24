Commits signature is really valuable thing. It ensures:
1. Authenticity verification - the author is verified and it's the author of the change
2. Integrity assurance - the content of commit didn't change after signification
3. Prevention of unathorized changes - if the practice of project require signed commits, unathorized users cannot change trusted commits.
4. GitHub rebase and merge should be made locally, to save the signature on pull request
